It also supports many of the familiar computational elements of NumPy.  However, while NumPy directly executes computations, e.g. when you run a + b, theano instead builds up a \"compute graph\" that tracks that you want to perform the + operation on the elements a and b.  Only when you `eval()` a theano expression does the computation take place (i.e. theano is lazy evaluated).  Once the compute graph is built, we can perform all kinds of mathematical optimizations (e.g. simplifications), compute gradients via `autodiff`, compile the entire graph to C to run at machine speed, and also compile it to run on the GPU.  PyMC3 is basically a collection of theano symbolic expressions for various probability distributions that are combined to one big compute graph making up the whole model log probability, and a collection of inference algorithms that use that graph to compute probabilities and gradients. For practical purposes, what this means is that in order to build certain models we sometimes have to use theano.\n",

    "### Modeling approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting thought to Bayesian modeling is to think about how your data might have been generated.  Position yourself in an omniscient position, and try to imagine how you would recreate the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last chapter we investigated text message data.  We begin by asking how our observations may have been generated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We started by thinking \"what is the best random variable to describe this count data?\"  A Poisson random variable is a good candidate because it can represent count data.  So we model the number of sms's received as sampled from a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we think, \"Ok, assuming sms's are Poisson-distributed, what do I need for the Poisson distribution?\" Well, the Poisson distribution has a parameter $\\lambda$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Do we know $\\lambda$?  No.  In fact, we have a suspicion that there are two $\\lambda$ values, one for the earlier behaviour and one for the later behaviour.  We don't know when the behaviour switches though, but call the switchpoint $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a good distribution for the two $\\lambda$s? The exponential is good, as it assigns probabilities to positive real numbers.  Well the exponential distribution has a parameter too, call it $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Do we know what the parameter $\\alpha$ might be?  No.  At this point, we could continue and assign a distribution to $\\alpha$, but it's better to stop once we reach a set level of ignorance: whereas we have a prior belief about $\\lambda$, (\"it probably changes over time\", \"it's likely between 10 and 30\", etc.), we don't really have any strong beliefs about $\\alpha$. So it's best to stop here.  \n",
    "What is a good value for $\\alpha$ then? We think that the $\\lambda$s are between 10-30, so if we set $\\alpha$ really low (which corresponds to larger probability on high values) we are not reflecting our prior well.  Similar, a too-high alpha misses our prior belief as well.  A good idea for $\\alpha$ as to reflect our belief is to set the value so that the mean of $\\lambda$, given $\\alpha$, is equal to our observed mean. This was shown in the last chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We have no expert opinion of when $\\tau$ might have occurred.  So we will suppose $\\tau$ is from a discrete uniform distribution over the entire timespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we give a graphical visualization of this, where arrows denote parent-child relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7J30oCG.png\" width = 700/>\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3, and other probabilistic programming languages, have been designed to tell these data-generation stories. More generally, B. Cronin writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Probabilistic programming will unlock narrative explanations of data, one of the holy grails of business analytics and the unsung hero of scientific persuasion. People think in terms of stories - thus the unreasonable power of the anecdote to drive decision-making, well-founded or not. But existing analytics largely fails to provide this kind of story; instead, numbers seemingly appear out of thin air, with little of the causal context that humans prefer when weighing their options.\n"

    "### Example: Bayesian A/B testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is a statistical design pattern for determining the difference of effectiveness between two different treatments.  For example, a pharmaceutical company is interested in the effectiveness of drug A vs drug B. The company will test drug A on some fraction of their trials, and drug B on the other fraction (this fraction is often 1/2, but we will relax this assumption). After performing enough trials, the in-house statisticians sift through the data to determine which drug yielded better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, front-end web developers are interested in which design of their website yields more sales or some other metric of interest. They will route some fraction of visitors to site A, and the other fraction to site B, and record if the visit yielded a sale or not. The data is recorded (in real-time), and analyzed afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the post-experiment analysis is done using something called a hypothesis test like difference of means test or difference of proportions test. This involves often misunderstood quantities like a \"Z-score\" and even more confusing \"p-values\" (please don't ask). If you have taken a statistics course, you have probably been taught this technique (though not necessarily learned this technique). And if you were like me, you may have felt uncomfortable with their derivation -- good: the Bayesian approach to this problem is much more natural."

    "### A Simple Case\n",
    "\n",
    "As this is a hacker book, we'll continue with the web-dev example. For the moment, we will focus on the analysis of site A only. Assume that there is some true $0<p_A<1$ probability that users who, upon shown site A, eventually purchase from the site. This is the true effectiveness of site A. Currently, this quantity is unknown to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose site A was shown to $N$ people, and $n$ people purchased from the site.  One might conclude hastily that $p_A=\\frac{n}{N}$.  Unfortunately, the observed frequency $\\frac{n}{N}$ does not necessarily equal $p_A$ -- there is a difference between the observed frequency and the true frequency of an event.  The true frequency can be interpreted as the probability of an event occurring.  For example, the true frequency of rolling a 1 on a 6-sided die is 16\n",
    "\n",
    ". Knowing the true frequency of events like:\n",
    "* fraction of users who make purchases,\n",
    "* frequency of social attributes,\n",
    "* percent of internet users with cats \n",
    "* etc.  \n",
    "are common requests we ask of Nature.  Unfortunately, often Nature hides the true frequency from us and we must infer it from observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed frequency is then the frequency we observe: say rolling the die 100 times you may observe 20 rolls of 1. The observed frequency, 0.2, differs from the true frequency, 16. We can use Bayesian statistics to infer probable values of the true frequency using an appropriate prior and observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to our A/B example, we are interested in using what we know, $N$ (the total trials administered) and $n$ (the number of conversions), to estimate what $p_A$, the true frequency of buyers, might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup a Bayesian model, we need to assign prior distributions to our unknown quantities.  A priori, what do we think $p_A$ might be? For this example, we have no strong conviction about pA, so for now, let's assume pA is uniform over [0,1]:"

    "### An algorithm for human deceit\n",
    "\n",
    "Social data has an additional layer of interest as people are not always honest with responses, which adds a further complication into inference. F or example, simply asking individuals \"Have you ever cheated on a test?\" will surely contain some rate of dishonesty.  What you can sa}y for certain is that the true rate is less than your observed rate (assuming individuals lie only about not cheating; I cannot imagine one who would admit \"Yes\" to cheating when in fact they hadn't cheated).\n",
    "\n",
    "To present an elegant solution to circumventing this dishonesty problem, and to demonstrate Bayesian modeling, we first need to introduce the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The binomial distribution is one of the most popular distributions, mostly because of its simplicity and usefulness. Unlike the other distributions we have encountered thus far in the book, the binomial distribution has 2 parameters: N\n",
    ", a positive integer representing N trials or number of instances of potential events, and p, the probability of an event occurring in a single trial. Like the Poisson distribution, it is a discrete distribution, but unlike the Poisson distribution, it only weighs integers from 0 to N. The mass distribution looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(X=k) = \\ ^{k}C_{N} p^ k (1−p)^{N−k}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ is a binomial random variable with parameters $p$ and $N$, denoted $X∼Bin(N,p)$, then $X$ is the number of events that occurred in the $N$ trials (obviously $0 \\le X\\le N$). The larger $p$ is (while still remaining between 0 and 1), the more events are likely to occur. The expected value of a binomial is equal to $Np$.  Below we plot the mass probability distribution for varying parameters."

    "### Example: Cheating among students\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the binomial distribution to determine the frequency of students cheating during an exam. If we let $N$\n",
    "be the total number of students who took the exam, and assuming each student is interviewed post-exam (answering without consequence), we will receive integer $X$ \"Yes I did cheat\" answers.  We then find the posterior distribution of $p$, given $N$, some specified prior on $p$, and observed data $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a completely absurd model.  No student, even with a free-pass against punishment, would admit to cheating.  What we need is a better algorithm to ask students if they had cheated.  Ideally the algorithm should encourage individuals to be honest while preserving privacy.  The following proposed algorithm is a solution I greatly admire for its ingenuity and effectiveness:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the interview process for each student, the student flips a coin, hidden from the interviewer. The student agrees to answer honestly if the coin comes up heads. Otherwise, if the coin comes up tails, the student (secretly) flips the coin again, and answers \"Yes, I did cheat\" if the coin flip lands heads, and \"No, I did not cheat\", if the coin flip lands tails. This way, the interviewer does not know if a \"Yes\" was the result of a guilty plea, or a Heads on a second coin toss. Thus privacy is preserved and the researchers receive honest answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I call this the Privacy Algorithm.  One could of course argue that the interviewers are still receiving false data since some Yes's are not confessions but instead randomness, but an alternative perspective is that the researchers are discarding approximately half of their original dataset since half of the responses will be noise. But they have gained a systematic data generation process that can be modeled. Furthermore, they do not have to incorporate (perhaps somewhat naively) the possibility of deceitful answers. We can use PyMC3 to dig through this noisy model, and find a posterior distribution for the true frequency of liars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose 100 students are being surveyed for cheating, and we wish to find $p$, the proportion of cheaters.  There are a few ways we can model this in PyMC3.  I'll demonstrate the most explicit way, and later show a simplified version.  Both versions arrive at the same inference.  In our data-generation model, we sample $p$, the true proportion of cheaters, from a prior.  Since we are quite ignorant about $p$, we will assign it a $\\ Uniform(0,1)$ prior."

    "With regards to the above plot, we are still pretty uncertain about what the true frequency of cheaters might be, but we have narrowed it down to a range between 0.05 to 0.35 (marked by the solid lines). This is pretty good, as a priori we had no idea how many students might have cheated (hence the uniform distribution for our prior).  On the other hand, it is also pretty bad since there is a 0.3 length window the true value most likely lives in.  Have we even gained anything, or are we still too uncertain about the true frequency?\n",

    "I would argue, yes, we have discovered something. It is implausible, according to our posterior, that there are no cheaters, i.e. the posterior assigns low probability to $p=0$. Since we started with an uniform prior, treating all values of $p$ as equally plausible, but the data ruled out $p=0$ as a possibility, we can be confident that there were cheaters.\n",

    "## Example: Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 28, 1986, the twenty-fifth flight of the U.S. space shuttle program ended in disaster when one of the rocket boosters of the Shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after lift-off, killing all seven crew members.  The presidential commission on the accident concluded that it was caused by the failure of an O-ring in a field joint on the rocket booster, and that this failure was due to a faulty design that made the O-ring unacceptably sensitive to a number of factors including outside temperature.  Of the previous 24 flights, data were available on failures of O-rings on 23, (one was lost at sea), and these data were discussed on the evening preceding the Challenger launch, but unfortunately only the data corresponding to the 7 flights on which there was a damage incident were considered important and these were thought to show no obvious trend.  The data are shown below:"

We only need to create a new Stochastic variable, that is exactly the same as our variable that stored the observations, but minus the observations themselves.  If you recall, our Stochastic variable that stored our observed data was:\n",
